# Headphones

This Ruby Gem provides a command line interface that shows us the list of top 15 headphones for 2019 recommended by www.cnet.com and allows the user to make comparisons through sorting the list by different characteristics: e.g. price, design, features, sound, value.

On top of the app's sorting features, the user is also able to filter the list according to a brand they want. For instance, if the user only wants to view Sony headphones, they can filter the list to only view Sony headphones.

It also gives the user the option to drill further down into price comparison or a summarized review for a specific headphone.
