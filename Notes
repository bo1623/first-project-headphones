- Used 'bundle gem headphones' in terminal to create this whole directory
- ./bin/headphones in the terminal returns an error "-bash: ./bin/headphones: Permission denied"
- ls-lah in terminal within the bin directory to show perms for each file
- "-rw-r--r--   1 boonsimoh  staff    40B  1 Jun 15:34 headphones" shows that the 'headphones' file is not executable
- "chmod +x headphones" in the terminal to make 'headphones' executable


- User types headphones
- Prints a list of top 10 headphones - brand and model names
- Gives user ability to sort by different type of metrics
- If user is interested in a particular set of headphones -> type in y/n in the terminal which would either
open the link on amazon if the answer is y or just print a "thank you" message if the input is 'n'
- see price in different currencies?
- Need to scrape for url to detailed price comparisons and reviews
- Add total points as one of attributes

Refactoring
- Had to split #more_details into two sections because if an invalid number was entered when asking for the headphone number,
the code would break with an error `more_details': no implicit conversion from nil to integer (TypeError)' due to this line
'What would you like to know more about the #{@list[index].name}?'
- The error arose because 'index' was set to be nil. Although the "else" condition within #more_details
  {else
    puts "Please enter 'exit' or a valid number between 1 to 15"
    more_details}
  And even if we entered a valid number, the input would still have been retained as the invalid number and index would not have
  been set before moving out of that block to print "What would you like to know more about the #{@list[index].name}?"
- So I created the #run_details method to be called within the #more_details method, only if the number entered was valid
  Otherwise, more_details would just keep getting called until a valid number or "exit" was typed
- So since I was splitting the initial #more_details into different sub-methods, I needed to create an instance variable out of
  "index" so that the specific headphone the user had chosen would be recognised in other methods
