- Used 'bundle gem headphones' in terminal to create this whole directory
- ./bin/headphones in the terminal returns an error "-bash: ./bin/headphones: Permission denied"
- ls-lah in terminal within the bin directory to show perms for each file
- "-rw-r--r--   1 boonsimoh  staff    40B  1 Jun 15:34 headphones" shows that the 'headphones' file is not executable
- "chmod +x headphones" in the terminal to make 'headphones' executable


- User types headphones
- Prints a list of top 10 headphones - brand and model names
- Gives user ability to sort by different type of metrics
- If user is interested in a particular set of headphones -> type in y/n in the terminal which would either
open the link on amazon if the answer is y or just print a "thank you" message if the input is 'n'
- see price in different currencies?
- Need to scrape for url to detailed price comparisons and reviews
